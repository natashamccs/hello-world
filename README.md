# hello-world

This is my first go on Github. I'm currently learning C via the EdX CS50 course and have also started learning Python.
I cannot wait to start my MSc in October. Software development here I come!

## UPDATE ##

I had to withdraw from the MSc due to changes in family circumstances, but I am thrilled to be embarking on the MAKERS software development coding bootcamp! 
With a focus on the skills required to work in software development, the appreciation of growth mindsets and the aim to be language agnostic, I am looking 
forwards to gaining the skills and confidence to work in multiple industries across a range of disciplines and the ability to learn and apply new languages fast.
